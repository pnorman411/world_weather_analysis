# World Weather Analysis

This project utilizes map and weather API keys along with customer input on desired minimum and maximum temperatures for their vacations to create heatmaps, search for hotels, and create marker layer maps.  The data collected from the APIs include the following information for each travel destination/hotel:  latitude, longitude, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, and temperature.  The final project includes a current weather description and an itinerary map and dataframe for traveling among four different cities.
